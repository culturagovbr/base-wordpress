Network admin can collect statistics networkwide with one GA account and let the regular admins collect statistics on their own sites with own accounts.

== Description ==

Google Analytics Multisite Async lets the network admin collect statistics from all sites and it lets the regular site admins collect statistics from their own site. This means that statistics are collected to 2 different Analytics accounts at once, assuming that the site admin have entered an ID of course. It's the asynchronous version of Analytics. The network admin can choose whether the site admins should be able to collect statistics or not.

The plugin is localized and available in:

* English
* Swedish
* German (Thanks Jenny at http://www.professionaltranslation.com)
* Dutch (Thanks Rene at http://wpwebshop.com)
* Persian (Thanks Sushynat at http://www.zavarzadeh.org)

If you translate it to more languages please send me the language files so I can include them here.

More information and a small guide how to setup your Analytics account filters to be prepared for networkwide statistics can be found at the plugin website:

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= I've translated your awesome plugin to another language. Could I send you the .po and .mo files? =

Yes, I will include your translation in future releases. E-mail me at `niklas [at] darturonline [dot] se`

= Does this work with subdirectories installation? =
 
This plugin have only been tested with the subdomains installation of WordPress Multisite.

But I can't think of any reason why it would not work with the subdirectories installation so if you are up to it, feel free to try. I suspect that it will be harder setting up filters in Analytics to see data from a specific site with subdirectories installation.

= Does it work with domain mapping? =

Yes, according to a user who have tried this it works with adding only one row of text to the tracking code and setting domain name to "none". More on this on the plugin website.
